You’ll use the following tools in this module:

    The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a development environment for building applications using Java. It also includes useful tools for developing and testing programs and allows you to install Java on your computer.

    IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java. You’ll use the IntelliJ IDEA to write the code for your Java application.

    Spring is an open-source application framework for the Java platform. Spring Boot is Spring's solution for creating standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications that require minimal configuration to get up and running. You’ll use Spring Initializr to create a Spring Boot Java microservice project. Its user interface allows you to select the project configuration variables and dependencies necessary for the project. 

You’ll add the following dependencies when setting up Spring Initializr:

    The Spring Web dependency allows developers to build RESTful web applications using Spring MVC.

    Spring Data JPA is an implementation of the Jakarta Persistence API, which is the Object Relational Mapper standard for storing, accessing, and managing Java objects in a relational database. For this course, you’ll use the Spring Data JPA dependency.

    MySQL Driver is the dependency that will connect your Java application to a MySQL database.

    Spring Session provides an API and implementations for managing a user’s session information. For this course, you’ll use the Spring Session dependency

    Thymeleaf is a Java template engine used to serve HTML at the View layer of MVC-based web applications. For this course, you’ll use the Thymeleaf dependency to integrate it as part of your Spring application.

    MVN (Maven) Repository is a dependency repository that you’ll use to find additional dependencies for your project, including the following:

    Spring Security is a framework that focuses on providing both authentication and authorization to Java applications. For this course, you’ll use the Spring Security Core dependency

    Thymeleaf Layout Dialect is a dialect for Thymeleaf that lets you build layouts and reusable templates in order to improve code reuse. For this course, you’ll use the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect dependency

    Spring Session JDBC provides SessionRepository implementation backed by a relational database and configuration support. For this course, you’ll use the Spring Session JDBC dependency](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.session/spring-session-jdbc).

    MySQL Workbench is a unified visual tool that provides a user interface so that developers can visually design, model, generate, and manage MySQL databases.

    Insomnia Core is a powerful REST API client that allows us to test APIs and make client-side server requests without having to use a browser.

        Note

        You'll use Insomnia Core to test your APIs—NOT Insomnia Designer.
